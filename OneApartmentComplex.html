          <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; In response to COVID-19, and there is no convenient
            way to control access to the community, this project was developed
            to allow the community to conduct e-management through links to
            webpages and APPs, which can not only improve the efficiency of
            community operations, but also enable residents to get closer to
            community life , It is no longer necessary to obtain new information
            through traditional announcements or go to the management room to
            handle trivial matters in person. Just use the APP to grasp the big
            and small things in life. During the epidemic, unnecessary contact
            can be minimized and the risk of community infection can be reduced.

            &nbsp; &nbsp; In order to solve community problems, we developed
            "OneApartmentComplex" to help the community develop bette. To
            expand, we have established three major modules (account management,
            community life, community interaction) to allow system design. There
            are more comprehensive functions in the account management module.
            In the account management module, this topic has the following
            functions "register & sign in, personal notification". In the
            community life module, this question realizes the following
            functions "public column management, community Regulations,
            feedback, package mailing, community repair, car calling, visitor
            management, gas form, management In the community interaction
            module, this topic has realized the following functions "community
            voting, chat room, Events and registration, planning the itinerary".
